<h1 align="center">Hey guys, Gabriel here! ðŸ¤–</h1>

Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Exact Sciences at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF), with over 4 years of professional experience as a Full Stack Developer. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I balance evening university classes with full-time work during the day.

I began my path at Code Junior, the UFJF computing junior enterprise, where I progressed from Developer and Q.A. Assistant to Project and Commercial Director. In these roles, I led teams, engaged with clients and stakeholders, and actively participated in all stages of software development.

Later, I joined Sensio's team, an ERP system for industries, focusing on production and inventory control. There, I developed strong skills in technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB.

While my online presence may be more understated due to the extensive workload between work and studies, I maintain a consistent commitment to technical excellence and continuous improvement. My projects on GitHub are usually related to academic work, personal projects, and professional development courses. I use Wakatime to monitor my programming routine, reflecting my dedication to efficiency and progress in the field.

I invite you to learn more about my journey and skills on my Wakatime profile: [Wakatime - ResendiK2](https://wakatime.com/@ResendiK2).
